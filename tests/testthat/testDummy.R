# testDummy.R
#
# Dummy tests as a template for unit testing in test-driven development
# for the zu project. If you test code that writes information to log-files,
# turn logging off for all tests except for one specific block in which
# you verify and validate your logs. Do not use your own log-file but
# rely on the global option that is set in the setup block. We have good
# code samples for most tests you will need - if you are not sure where to find
# them, ask. Do not reinvent the wheel, but write your code according to the
# principles you find in the existing files.
#
# Structure your tests according to the three principles expressed below:
#    test_that("parameter errors are correctly handled", { ... })
#    test_that("a sane input gives an expected output", { ... })
#    test_that("a corrupt input does not lead to corrupted output", { ...})
